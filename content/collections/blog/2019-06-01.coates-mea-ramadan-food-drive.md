        text: 'In 2018, our Coates MEA team launched a charitable initiative called Ramadan Food Drive to celebrate the last week of Ramadan, a month of fasting, prayer, reflection and community. A total of 100 neatly packed and delicious ‘Kindness Iftar Boxes’ were distributed by our Coates Crew members.'

        text: 'Each ‘Kindness Iftar Box’ contained Chicken Biryani, Mix Pakora, fresh fruit, dates, Raita (yoghurt) and Gulab Jamun. As always, it was such a rewarding experience because at Coates, we believe there is an undeniable joy in giving back.'
