        text: "Starbucks entered the Australian market in 2000 with its first store in Sydney. Despite initial challenges—including market saturation and a change of ownership in 2014—the brand has rebuilt its presence with renewed focus. Today, Starbucks Australia is in a new phase of growth, driven by a clear strategy focused on customer experiences, digital innovation, and sustainable expansion.\_"

        text: "Among the core objectives of Starbucks Australia’s growth strategy, two are particularly significant: expanding its store footprint through drive-thru formats and enhancing the customer journey through digital innovation. These were designed to meet evolving consumer expectations, favouring speed, convenience, and connected customer experiences, while preserving the brand’s commitment to high-quality service and community connection.\_"

        text: "Drive-thrus align with the increasing consumer demand for speed and convenience, offering a more accessible and flexible way to enjoy the Starbucks experience. Starbucks drive-thru approach has proven especially successful in Western Australia, where the recent launch of three new stores drew queues of up to two hours, underscoring the strong local appetite for drive-thru formats. \_While there are no drive-thru-only Starbucks locations, every drive-thru has a full-size café attached, providing a complete Starbucks store experience with at least 30 seats to accommodate dine-in customers while supporting high-volume, fast service. While approximately 60% of Starbucks stores in Australia are currently traditional cafés and 40% are drive-thrus, this balance is set to shift. With more than 50 new stores in the pipeline—most of them drive-thrus—Starbucks expects drive-thru locations to soon outnumber cafés.\_"

        text: "Alongside its physical expansion, Starbucks is also heavily investing in digital transformation in their new stores and remodels, with plans to extend these innovations to its existing network of static stores. Key focus areas include enhancing mobile ordering capabilities, integrating loyalty programs, and embedding digital touchpoints across drive-thrus and in-store experiences. Starbucks envisions a fully connected customer journey, with innovations such as personalised digital menu boards that adapt in real-time to factors like customer preferences and weather conditions to further elevate the experience.\_"
