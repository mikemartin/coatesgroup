        text: "Amber, from our HR team just happens to be a Chicago improviser, working at places like The Second City and Improv Olympic. She, alongside some friends, led improv-based teambuilding exercises throughout the afternoon. It was a great opportunity to get to know our colleagues. Our theme for the event was centered around one of our Coates Values, “One In, All In”. \_Through the sometimes goofy, and always enlightening activities we were able to come together, focus on teamwork, and learn about each other’s personalities and how to communicate effectively in the work place."
