        text: 'Content is king’ is one of the most common phrases used in marketing today; it is not content itself that drives success, but the strategy behind it. Coates has learned that the most fundamental question at the beginning of a relationship with a new client is “What is your content strategy for in-store merchandising?”'

        text: "After decades in the business, Coates has learned the key of success is expertly determining the right solution for the specific client, and how to readily deploy it. There is no one right approach to rolling out a project of scale, it’s a science of defining the brands top objectives for their market and how that environment will react. It's important to not just\_be any other supplier, but a transformative partner for your clients."

        text: "Coates have found that the most effective and efficient deployments involved partnering with brands from the get go, and walking them through a digital journey. It can be overwhelming turning on all functionality at once, which is why Coates use a staged deployment approach, to measure the success of various content, location and product configurations. It's crucial to have a unit of experts in content, technology and strategy to ensure a well-developed and measured approach is used to analyze what works and what doesn’t."
