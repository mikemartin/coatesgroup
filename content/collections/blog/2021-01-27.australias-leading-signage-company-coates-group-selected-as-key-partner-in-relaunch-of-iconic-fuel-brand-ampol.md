The project requires over 30 signage variations – including main identity signs, price boards, shopfront fascias, and other applications for the Ampol marks and logos – which were designed and prototyped in under a month.

My family founded Coates as a traditional signage business, and while we’ve since made a successful transition into the digital technology space, we’re always thrilled to return to our roots and deliver our forward-looking, refined suite of signage products. Partnerships like this one with Ampol are what motivate us to continually innovate both our static and digital solutions to help our clients cultivate the best experiences for their customers,”'
