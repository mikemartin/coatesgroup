Additionally, 60% of the signs required braille and tactile elements to comply with Australian standards. With each site requiring between 60 and 150 signs, tailored to its specific context, the project demanded meticulous planning and coordination to address the individual needs of each campus while maintaining overall consistency and high standards.\_"

These elements allow users to simply scan the code or tap the NFC tag with their smartphones, directing them to an interactive digital map of the specific TAFE campus. This initiative not only enhances the user experience by making navigation more intuitive and tech-enabled but also reinforces TAFE NSW’s commitment to inclusivity and accessibility. By combining digital tools with compliant braille and tactile signage, the project delivered a modern, multi-layered wayfinding solution that caters to a diverse range of users.\_"

Training was then provided to the Coates Design team in China, equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to incorporate these elements effectively into the designs. Close collaboration with factory partners was also integral to the project's success. Both worked meticulously to produce high-quality signs that met all compliance requirements. This involved ensuring precision in braille dot placement, raised lettering, and symbol clarity, while also conducting rigorous quality checks to guarantee accuracy and readability.\_"
