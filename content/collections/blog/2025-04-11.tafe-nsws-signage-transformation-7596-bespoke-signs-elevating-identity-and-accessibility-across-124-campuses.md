Additionally, 60% of the signs required braille and tactile elements to comply with Australian standards. With each site requiring up to 200+ signs, tailored to its specific environmental context, the project demanded meticulous planning and coordination, to address the individual needs of each campus while maintaining overall consistency and high standards.\_"

These elements allow users to simply scan the code or tap the NFC tag with their smartphones, directing them to an interactive digital map of the specific TAFE campus. This initiative not only enhances the user experience by making navigation more intuitive and tech-enabled but also reinforces TAFE NSW’s commitment to inclusivity and accessibility. By combining digital tools with compliant braille and tactile signage, the project delivered a modern, multi-layered wayfinding solution that caters to a diverse range of users.\_"
