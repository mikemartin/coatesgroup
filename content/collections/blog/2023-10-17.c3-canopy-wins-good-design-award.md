        text: "The sustainable focus of the C3 Canopy ultimately informed the design outcome. C3 uses smart materials like the solar glass roof for shade and shelter while capturing solar energy when the sun’s out and rainwater when it’s wet. The glass roof is supported by the glulam timber which sequests carbon, capturing it and storing it within the timber, instead of producing carbon during manufacture. The modular structure is designed to suit various environments while promoting sustainability and innovation.\_"
