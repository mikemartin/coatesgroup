        text: 'Historically, society has taught us to try and figure out how someone might identify by the way they look, however, some people have a gender identity that doesn’t necessarily correlate to what you might think by the way they express themselves.

That is why it is so important to pay attention to our email signature pronouns, because they might not stay the same. If someone choses to not include their pronouns on their email signature, it is not appropriate to ask them directly. Instead, offer up your pronouns to signal to them that you’ve created a safe space for them to share theirs when they feel comfortable.'
