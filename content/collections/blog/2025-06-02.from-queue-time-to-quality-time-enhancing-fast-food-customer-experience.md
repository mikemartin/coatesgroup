        text: "The most significant shift we are helping to enable for leading QSR brands goes beyond just improving speed of service—it's about rethinking how customers spend their time in the restaurant. By mapping every customer interaction, and creating connection between each one, our goal is to maximise positive experience time (value time—engaging with brand content) and minimise necessary experience time (void time—waiting in line). Digital menu boards play a part in helping to achieve this by transforming wait time into a more valuable and engaging part of the visit—enhancing the in-store experience and adding value to each interaction.\_"

        text: "The evolution of digital touchpoints has been remarkable. Before digital menu boards existed, static menu boards were essentially information sharing tools. The first iteration of digital boards optimised this process, but we're now seeing a shift where ordering takes place away from the restaurant through mobile apps.\_\_"

        text: "Since customers are interacting with the brand before arrival, we must consider this in the customers experience that occurs upon arrival. This creates opportunities to bring mobile digital engagement to life in the physical restaurant in an omni channel experience. With some decisions already made before arrival, the focus should shift to elevating the customer experience and creating a deeper brand engagement through a seamless and connected journey.\_"
