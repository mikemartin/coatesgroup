        text: "There's design excellence in redefining a category that was purely functional and reductionist to something more appealing, attractive and approachable with inviting forms, surfaces, materials and colours. There's a great combination of industrial and natural materials that makes this an inviting product to use. It has a simple form with limited visible technology which makes it less threatening as a tool. Well done."
