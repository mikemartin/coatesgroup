More than 55 Good Design Awards Jurors evaluated each entry according to a strict set of design criteria which covers ‘good design’, ‘design innovation’ and ‘design impact’. Projects recognised with a Good Design Award must demonstrate excellence in good design and convince the Jury they are worthy of recognition at this level."

        text: "There's design excellence in redefining a category that was purely functional and reductionist to something more appealing, attractive and approachable with inviting forms, surfaces, materials and colours. There's a great combination of industrial and natural materials that makes this an inviting product to use. It has a simple form with limited visible technology which makes it less threatening as a tool. Well done."

We carefully considered and challenged our approach to the form, function and flexibility of the kiosk, focusing on the user journey and concealing distracting features - providing visual clarity to the overall design that is clean and inviting, and facilitating an immersive customer experience.”'
