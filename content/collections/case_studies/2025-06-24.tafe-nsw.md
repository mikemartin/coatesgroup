            text: ' an Australian leading project management company, to jointly deliver this large-scale, complex government project. The project involved not only 30 signage variations but also each sign had to be bespoke, requiring the production of 7,596 unique signs for 124 campuses across New South Wales, making this project both unique and complex. Additionally, 60% of the signs required braille and tactile elements to comply with Australian standards. To further support accessibility and improve navigation across campuses, 20% of wayfinding signs also feature QR codes and NFC tags. With each site requiring up to 200+, tailored to its specific context, the project demanded meticulous planning and coordination to address the individual needs of each campus while maintaining overall consistency and high standards.'
