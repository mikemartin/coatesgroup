        text: 'Coates Group first formed a partnership with McDonald’s in Australia in the 1970s as a traditional signage and merchandising provider. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the partnership grew into Asian and European markets with the introduction of new signage technology. Following Coates’ evolution into the digital merchandising space in the 2010s, the partnership expanded even further across the world. In 2017, Coates Group was awarded the Outdoor Digital Menu Board hardware rollout for McDonald’s US, which was the largest QSR menu board rollout completed to date. Today, Coates is supporting 50 McDonald’s markets – including the US, Canada, Australia, France, and the UK – with digital merchandising solutions such as CMS, DMB and self-order kiosk.'
