        text: 'With retail and restaurant technology advancing so rapidly, bringing ideas and products to life before they are superseded is a real issue brands continually struggle with. With the Coates Lab VR tool, creative teams and designers can immediately see their merchandising ideas come to life using a VR simulation of the customers’ environment. Until now, the first time a client saw the finished product was at the end of the design and manufacturing process, stimulating a wave of inspiration about what would work better and how to improve the experience. Unfortunately, these light bulb moments are often realized too late. The costs, time, and finite resources prevent the client from achieving the best result possible. The Coates Lab now transforms that experience allowing brands to go on that creative journey, test “riskier” concepts through the eyes of their customers without prototyping, time delays or incurring huge costs.'

The VR tool has proven to be a powerful and effective method to help brand designers, marketers and development teams efficiently ideate their own virtual store, and quickly land on the ideal design without costly and time-consuming prototypes,” says Leo Coates, CEO of Coates Group. “Brands can walk through their concept environment and change the content on digital signage using our proprietary Switchboard\_TM\_CMS, to test and visualize how different campaigns roll out in stores, allowing for real-time revisions to the proposed store environment.”"
