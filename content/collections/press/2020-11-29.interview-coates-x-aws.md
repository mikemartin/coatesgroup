        text: 'We believe that human connection and human touch is so critically important, especially in the unexpected situations of today, created by the COVID-19 pandemic. What we’re seeing is that brands and customers have had to respond with changes in their operating models and the ability to communicate effectively and rapid is crucial so much more today. Using digital merchandising as a medium allows brands to educate customers when they arrive at a location, turn up in a drive thru or even a store. We focus on not only what customers interact with in-store and what they purchase, but also how they interact with brands and their products.'

        text: 'AWS has been with us on a journey since we launched Switchboard about seven or eight years ago. We’re grown and evolved with AWS and it’s been fantastic. AWS provides all our cloud services and with the continued evolution of their tool sets, we’re leveraged AWS’s stack. It has allowed us to look at ways to focus on what we’re good at, which is influencing the customer journey, and not have to worry so much about servers, back-end and infrastructure. We’ve maintained a close working relationship with the AWS team to understand how we can always better our structure and build our architecture in a more efficient and cohesive manner.'
