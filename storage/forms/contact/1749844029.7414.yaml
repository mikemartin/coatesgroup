message_body: "Good Morning Coates Group Folks,\r\n\r\nNew coupon laws in Illinois USA mean big business for Coates Group [potentially]. Illinois like other states is going to require a system to deliver all available coupons to any shopper. Digital or otherwise. This is a simple problem to solve with your kiosk, a QR code to load the app on the home screen, and for non app folks get the screen experience & on demand printout. Otherwise the coupons could be loaded to the phone or a digital shopper account that synced with the store. This SHOULD be tuned into a revenue generation center for the business. Selling the preferred  coupon space like they do shelves. Meanwhile they need enough printed coupons in hand to serve everyone that wants one. Not efficient, bad for the environment, kills trees. I could sell this... \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Lynch\r\n312-882-0900"
