message_body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI’m reaching out to ask about the compatibility of this device with dynamic drive-thru screens, similar to those used at McDonald’s, and whether you would be able to put a package with installment and all the systems for screens together.\r\n\r\nWe already have the software to support this functionality, but we’d like to confirm whether your device can handle continuous, real-time screen updates reliably throughout the day.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we are attempting to integrate an AI agent with the display, like to assist with voice ordering or customer interaction. Would this device be capable of supporting that kind of AI-driven functionality, through a connected system?"
