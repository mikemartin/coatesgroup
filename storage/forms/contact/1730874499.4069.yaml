message_body: "Hi Team, \r\n\r\nMy name is Skye Sharpe, I am the Chief Corporate Officer at The Navy's Anchorage. We are a non-for-profit that supports the Welfare of the Australian Sailor. In order to generate venue we run commercial cafe businesses in which the profits are then dispersed back to Navy Sailors in the form of sponsorships, grants, loans and other welfare activities. \r\n\r\nWe currently have approx. 35 digital screens/digital menu boards in our venues across the country. We are looking at wanting to upgrade our digital signage software and were hoping to get an indication of your pricing for software only as we already have relatively new intel sticks in the back on the screens.  \r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you. \r\n\r\nSkye"
