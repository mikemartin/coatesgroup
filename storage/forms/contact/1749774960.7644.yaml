message_body: "Good morning Team,\r\nI'm trying to organise quotes for supply only of a LED retrofit for our Lavington McDonalds pylons, one located on the side of Wagga road, and another located beside Griffith road, Previous contacts I've used in Coates Group must no longer work for the company as emails bounce back.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to get 3 quotes for the LED upgrade, supply only:\r\n1) just for the pylon beside Wagga road.\r\n2) just for the pylon beside Griffith road.\r\n3) quote for both pylons.\r\n\r\nAlso on Wagga road pylon, we have a Bowtie sign which says McCafe, and just below it another square sign that says McCafe drive-thru. What the current cost of getting a new Bowtie that says open 24/7 or other current McDonalds signs for the Bowtie.\r\n\r\nRegards,"
