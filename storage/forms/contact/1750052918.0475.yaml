message_body: "Attn:- Marketing Manager\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nCongratulations on supporting the 2024 Australian V8 Supercar Series.\r\n\r\nI have been a longtime supporter of COATES, and a supporter of the series since the Supercar Series began.\r\n\r\nPrior to that, ever since the Mid 70's I have been a lover of Motorsport, mainly the Saloon Cars.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, normal life has not been with me, and I have had numerous health situations with life to compete with.\r\n\r\nOne of the Major situations has been a Brain Tumor that I had in 2000. I am still not 100% but have been informed by the Doctors that It is something that I may never recover from, but then again with Modern Medicines a symptom may be found any day!\r\n\r\nBasically, I just live day to day!\r\n\r\nStill, I always relax in front of the Television when the Supercar Series is on!\r\n\r\nMy study is covered with Supercar Posters and memorabilia, and that's what gets me out of bed in the Mornings.\r\n\r\nI am counting down to retirement age 65, but due to medical conditions, am unable to do general work.\r\n\r\nFor a profession, I am a Self-Employed Gardener/Lawnmower.\r\n\r\nI have days when I work hard, then all of a sudden, I can't. I have to go and lie Down.\r\n\r\nGee, life can be tough!\r\n\r\nOn days like today though, it is great, I can stay indoors and do things for myself. (It is pouring with Rain outside!).\r\n\r\nMy address is:\r\n\r\nMr. Al Rankin,\r\n90 Hastings Rd,\r\nMairangi Bay,\r\nAuckland 0630\r\nNew Zealand\r\n\r\nSo, anything would be fantastic. It is always good to go to the letter box and find something there!\r\n\r\nHave a terrific week, and thanks for fully reading my request.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAl"
