message_body: "Taica Corporation manufactures Silicone based products for Vibration Isolation, Shock Absorption, as well as Silicone OCA.  We are very well known in Japan, but not much known in the United States.  Through my marketing activities, I have started to engage with many companies doing Digital Signage where our material is strong against UV exposure as well as other harsh environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you can provide me and opportunity to show you who we are and what we do.  Our office is in Cupertino, CA but I work out of my home office in Chicagoland.  \r\n\r\nI will be looking forward in hearing from you."
