message_body: "Hello! Hoping this finds you well! I'm after information of our store front signage and the big Golden Arches pylon, we have some lights out and they're getting pretty gritty (need probably a cherry picker or similar to fix them up) - can I get a quote on replacement bulbs and repairs/maintenance? I was told to contact you guys, but cant find a phone number. mine is 0437209330 if you're up for a chat. Appreciate your time and I look forward to your favourable response."
