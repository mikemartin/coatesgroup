message_body: "Subject: Employment Offer Verification â€“ IT Support Specialist Role\r\n\r\nDear Coates Group Team,\r\n\r\nI recently received an email offering me a position as an IT Support Specialist with Coates Group, including details about onboarding, training via Zoom, and initial workspace setup funded by a mailed check.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed, I wanted to ensure this opportunity is legitimate and truly from your organization. The message mentioned daily duties via email and future communication via Google Chat, but did not include an official Coates Group domain or contact information that I could verify.\r\n\r\nI am very interested in the opportunity if it is authentic and aligned with your hiring practices. I would appreciate it if you could confirm whether this offer originated from Coates Group.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to your guidance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJose Fonseca\r\nFonseca_jc12@outlook.com"
