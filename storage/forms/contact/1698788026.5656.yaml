message_body: "Hello there, \r\n\r\nWe are currently having problems with our receipt printing cables in our kiosk systems. We cannot replace ourselves as they are wired into the equipment. We are located in Balwyn and our store number 0065. \r\n\r\nIf we could have someone out to look at our receipt printers and fix if possible, that would be great. \r\n\r\nIf you need any other information, please let me know. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nJemma Wright\r\nRestaurant Manager \r\nBalwyn McDonalds"
