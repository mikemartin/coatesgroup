I have searched this airport twice for the tech and gave him directions where to walk to meet me at the loading dock to bring him up the back way which is required here.  I have not found him and I cannot keep waiting for him.  If I don't hear within the next few minutes, it will need to be rescheduled.  I will not keep waiting."
