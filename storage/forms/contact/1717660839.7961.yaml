message_body: "Could you please help me forward the email to your international shipping manager?\r\n â€‹\r\nHi Manager,\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you're having a great day.\r\n\r\nThis is Jimmy from Fourever International Limited, a freight forwarding company.\r\n\r\nRecently, ocean freight rates have been increasing significantly, and are expected to rise further next month. Space is becoming particularly limited on the route from China to the western United States.\r\n\r\nI understand that your company regularly ships materials from China. We can arrange door-to-door transportation from China to the USA for you. If you have any cargo that needs shipping, please provide us with the following details: Port of Loading (POL), Port of Discharge (POD), container type, and quantity. I will then apply for a special rate and provide you with a quote.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to the opportunity to cooperate with you.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nJimmy\r\nFourever International Limited"
