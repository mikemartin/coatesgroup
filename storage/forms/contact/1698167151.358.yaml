message_body: "To whom it may concern.. :) \r\n\r\nMy name is Samuel Parker, and I am reaching out to inquire about any developer/engineering career opportunities at Coates.\r\nI have three years of professional web development experience, with two of those years focused on React/TypeScript. My most recent position was as a full-time junior front-end developer at a fintech company called BMTx. Unfortunately, I was laid off in February of this year and have been freelancing since. I am now actively seeking a full-time role but am also open to considering contract positions. I am curious, passionate, and I work well in a team environment.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful to have a quick call to connect at any time thatâ€™s convenient for you. \r\n\r\nCalendly link: https://calendly.com/samuelaparker\r\nPhone: 860-402-7701\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time,\r\nSam\r\n\r\nLinkedIn: \r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelaparker/\r\nGithub:\r\nhttps://github.com/samuelaparker\r\nPersonal site:\r\nhttps://www.samuelaparker.com/\r\nPortfolio: \r\nhttps://www.samuelaparker.com/#portfolio-section"
