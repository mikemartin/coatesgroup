message_body: "We are a hospitality business at a hockey stadium and looking and upgrading how we display our menu to our customers though digital signage that can change during the day as we operate as a cafe in the morning and transition to a bar type establishment in the later afternoon evenings. We have two counters, one in front of the bar and another in front of the kitchen. All our orders are counter service. I’m looking for a simple and easy solution that is flexible enough that I can update pricing, promote new items and be easily seen. We may also hold events, so it’s ideal that we can change our menu or offering to meet their needs. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing back from you."
