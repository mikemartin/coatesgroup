message_body: "Hi, \r\nOur menu boards at the Nunawading McDonalds are still showing items from a few months ago promotion. I need to update the digital menu board players I believe but going through helpdesk they referred this issue to Coates. If someone could call me on 0421340840 or send an email to 0244@au.stores.mcd.com that would be greatly appreciated. \r\nThankyou"
