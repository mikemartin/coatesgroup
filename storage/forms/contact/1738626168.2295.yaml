message_body: "Hi There,\r\n\r\nI received a message from Jennifer Toyama regarding some video work in the Boston area. I tried to email her back a few times and the email got kicked back. \r\n\r\nCan you please forward her this message.\r\n\r\nMy name is Jeff Lazzarino and I'm the owner and Executive Producer at Maverick Productions Boston. We’d be thrilled to help bring your vision for the Coates Group videos to life and I’d love to learn more about your goals and creative direction for the project.\r\n \r\nWe have a lot of experience with the QSR industry and we worked with Dunkin' Brands for over 20 years. We did capture the install of an exterior digital menu board to be used for training purposes.  I think you project sounds similar and would love to hear more about your goals. We also worked with Cumberland Farms (almost 600 locations nationwide) for many years.\r\n \r\nAt Maverick, we pride ourselves on delivering exceptional video content with our Emmy Award-winning team. We’ve had the privilege of working with global and national brands, as well as partnering with local businesses and startups to tell their stories. Our productions leverage cutting-edge digital cinema cameras and lenses, supported by a talented crew of seasoned professionals. \r\n \r\nI'm pretty flexible from 10-1pm EST on Wednesday and could also do after 3pm on Wed.\r\n \r\nPlease let me know what works best and I'll send you over a Zoom like.\r\n \r\nI look forward to meeting you.\r\n \r\nThank you,\r\nJeff Lazzarino | Owner-Executive Producer\r\nMaverick Productions Boston - An Emmy Award Winning Team\r\n781-400-2696 Office\r\njlazzarino@maverickboston.com"
