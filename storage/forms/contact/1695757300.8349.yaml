message_body: "Hi,\r\nI am a Technical Program Manager at AWS. I work in a team called Prototype and Cloud Engineering. We have Builder Studio in NYC where we bring in customers and show them the Art of the Possible prototypes. We are currently building a Drive-Thru Gen AI Voice assisted ordering system that interacts with the Digital Sign board like yours using AWS technologies. I would love to partner with your team to have a Digital Board from COATES set up in the AWS studio to go with the prototype. Let me know if this is something your team will be interested in. Here is the link to our Studio in JFK. We can also have your use case and logo posted on the official Studio page. https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/aws-builder-studio/"
