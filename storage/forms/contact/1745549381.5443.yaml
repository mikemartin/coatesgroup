I understand M&A with a such Japanese company might be challenging and something new, however we believe it would be really great and valuable if you could spare some time to consider. \r\n\r\nFrankly speaking, there are quite a few companies in Japan that want to expand their business in Australia.\r\nIf you have even the slightest interest, we are happy to set up a remote meeting to explain more details, also about M&A in general by zoom or google meet.\r\n\r\nWe are a publicly listed Japanese company and carry out more than 100 M&A transactions a year.\r\nFor transferor companies, we are supporting M&A with a completely success-based fee system(no front fee/no retainerfee) since our foundation.\r\nJust for your reference, attached the Bloomberg article of our President and CEO, Shunsaku Sagami.\r\nhttps://ma-s.jp/x/76b9o\r\n\r\nI sincerely thank you for reading my email and looking forward to hearing back from you anytime soon.\r\n\r\nBest regards,"
