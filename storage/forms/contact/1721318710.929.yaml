I wanted to follow up on my recent job application for the Junior Digital Designer at Coates Group, which I applied for on July 10, 2024. I am wondering if any decisions have been made or how far along the hiring team is in the process.\r\n\r\nI would be ecstatic to work for a global technology company such as Coates Group, and believe my qualifications and work ethic would make me a great fit for this position!\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing my skills and experience more in an interview.\r\n\r\nVery best,\r\nLauren Lee"
