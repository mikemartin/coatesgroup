message_body: "Hello! I actually live in the building next-door to your West loop Chicago office and I am reaching out to talk to somebody about potentially parking in your lot. Parking has gotten extremely tight in the West loop and I'm looking to pay you guys a monthly rental fee to allow my car to be parked there. 90% of the time it will be after 3 PM and on the weekends only, so it shouldn't really impact business hours all too often, although it seems like there are always at least a few spots that are open during the day. I would love if somebody would reach out to me to talk about it further! \r\nKim Wagner\r\n708.989.5011\r\nKimberly.m.wagner@gmail.com"
