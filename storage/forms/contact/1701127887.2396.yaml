message_body: "Hi, My name is Michael Santinon and I'm the solutions and integrations engineer from Revel System POS. We are currently working with Guzman y Gomez on switching their POS to Revel. We currently service GyG in Singapore and Japan, but we are now looking to Convert them in Au and US. I'd like to discuss an integration to Revel for not only GyG, but other clients who are looking at large format Kiosk, as well as Menu boards and Drive thru tech.\r\nRegards,\r\nMichael."
