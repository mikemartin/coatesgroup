message_body: 'Hi, I’m trying to get a hold of your vendor relations department that dispatches out service tickets. I see that you guys use a couple companies to do your service calls in the United States and I would like to see about applying for that position. I know we could do a much better job than the company you currently use. Can you please give me a call back at 209-918-1727, thank you Rocco. I’ve been in business over 30 years now fully certified low-voltage company in Northern California.'
