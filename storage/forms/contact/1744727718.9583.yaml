message_body: 'Hello. I am a retired display engineer from IMAX and Christie and a generative artist producing Visual Music pieces using computers and software. I admired your digital signage menu boards in our local MacDonalds restaurant in Fergus and am interested in possibly using your displays for museum and art gallery type installations. My first install in Wellington Museum uses a Mac Mini to drive but I just purchased a BrightSign LS5 to drive 4K displays.  Could you please send me information on any low cost ultra reliable Full HD and 4K displays you use for long term installations? Tech specs and pricing - to email gordharris@icloud.com.  Also if you need any interactive immersive display help please see my website gordharrisart.com  Many thanks, Gord.'
