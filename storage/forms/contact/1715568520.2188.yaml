message_body: "I would like to start off with a compliment to Coates as to your technical support group for digital signage screen replacements. I work through different vendors you have contracted kinetics and USSI. Who are just as great to work with.\r\n  On my installations of different McDonald's in the Midwest it has come to my attention that you are going to replace under some owners have said some kind of warranty.\r\nI feel I could be of great help to you. See as you might know that if the broken 55 inch outdoor digital signage are not under warranty the owners usually say dispose of them. To me that was a waste. I have taught myself how to repair units unless the screen is damaged or discoloration is involved we both know it's the end of that screen . But there is still the unit cards fans and frame.\r\nHere is we're I know I could be of best interest to Coates I have access to a 9000 square foot warehouse with freight elevator and excellent loading dock 12 miles away from pilot freight. I am in the middle of the USA. There is no dought in my mind that if given the return monitors and the correct glass and new screens that I couldn't turn them back out in 7 days or less ready to ship until the last one is replaced. \r\nSincerely yours\r\nNeal Huggins\r\n913-827-2828\r\nCorrect Connect\r\ncnhhuggyy@gmail.com"
