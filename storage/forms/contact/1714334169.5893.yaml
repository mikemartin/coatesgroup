message_body: "To make a long story short I have replaced many OHA 55 INCH DIGITAL SIGNAGE BOARDS  For McDonald's here in the Midwest \r\nGoing on 10 years now. Many that weren't under warranty. So the owners said throw them away. I have self taught myself to repair them and have a number of them to get ride of. I tell you this because I do not and will not go around the ones that provide me the work to keep my doors open. This at hand I would be willing to let them go at a very reasonable price. If not I guess I will have one hell of a backyard movie theater. Your friend and small contractor\r\nNeal Huggins\r\n913-827-2828"
