I have technicians in both Saskatoon and Regina, but we cover all Prairie Provinces.

We would like to help fill the gap and offer our professional services to you in the Prairies. \r\nOur techs are extremely resourceful, and our team works hard to ensure all work completed is done to the highest possible quality in a timely manner, we always strive for excellence.\r\nWe specialize in;\r\n- Low voltage cabling\r\n- Data rack installation and management\r\n- Camera installation\r\n- POS system installation and repair\r\n- Network equipment installation \r\n- Technician on site services\r\n- Computer repair\r\n- etc\r\nWe look forward to hearing back from you and hope to build a lasting relationship with your company.\r\nYou can reach me with any questions or concerns by email or phone at \r\n(306) 880-2095\r\nkira@sasktechservices.ca\r\n \r\n \r\nKira Sampson (she/her)\r\nCEO\r\nPh: (306) 880-2095\r\nEmail: kira@sasktechservices.ca\r\nsasktechservices.ca"
