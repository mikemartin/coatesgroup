message_body: "Hi Coatsy/team,\r\n\r\nAndrew King here (am friends with Leo) \r\n\r\nSo as a side hustle,  I’ve personally funded a new little fish n chip/chick shop in Freshwater on the northern beaches called “Calamari Kid” (think - “out of the blue” in Clovelly , but with some additional items like roast chickens). We open in a few weeks. \r\n\r\nWe were going to go for a chalkboard menu (old school) and a few ppl reminded me that I should maybe chat to you/your team about what some digital menus could look like? \r\n\r\nTrudey (Sam Trude - Great White) likes the concept so much that he is coming in on the venture with me too ! So I may end up doing few if this goes well. \r\n\r\nAny help from you/your team appreciated. \r\n\r\nAK"
