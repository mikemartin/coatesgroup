message_body: "I just wanted to inform you guys of an ongoing scam in terms of job interview/offerings that are using your company as a face for them. The people are using the e-mail address kanecassidy@coatesgroupcareer.com to pretend to be apart of your hiring staff. Nothing really much more to say, but if you do have any remote positions in the U.S for IT remote support I'm interested! Thank you for your time."
