message_body: "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI hope this finds you well. I am writing as I received an email about doing an interview on Tuesday 07/22/2025 at 10am EST. My concern is after reverifying via looking through my submitted applications I did not apply to this company.\r\n\r\nThe email I received an interview email from was: kanecassidy@coatesgroupcareer.com\r\n\r\nI just want to confirm if this is a valid email address, if it is not I appreciate your time reviewing this.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n- Nathaniel Harris"
