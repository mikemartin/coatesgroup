message_body: "Good Morning, \r\nWe are having issues at PC 348554 with getting a quote for repair or to send a tech. We called this in early last week and now its Monday still have no quote that we are to approve. From my understanding there aren't anyone from the Management Team on during the weekends to help get things sent out in a timely fashion. It has been since Tuesday of this past week that our Digital Menus are down but doesn't seem like we are a priority to fix. I am shocked that this is how we service our menus as I would have expected a much quicker turn around for this sort of thing as well as much more support to streamline this issue. I look forward to hearing back from you regarding this."
