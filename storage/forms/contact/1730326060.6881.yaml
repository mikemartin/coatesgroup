message_body: 'My name is Vincent Arnold, I wanted to reach out to say that I am very interested in working for this company. Seeing that the focus of this company is on Digital Marketing and how this company is embracing the future with a more digital experience and digital world.  I am currently seeking a marketing internship for the summer of 2025 in the Chicagoland area,  A little background on me is that  I am a Junior  at University of Iowa majoring in Marketing and minoring in Communication and Management. A little snapshot of what I did this past summer is; I had a full time, hands on marketing/sales internship at Grayhill in Lagrange, IL. That opportunity allowed me to work with multiple marketing strategists on a variety of projects and weekly meetings with the Director of Marketing identifying global clientele and product placement. I walked away with a positive experience in marketing, however, I am looking to branch out in the marketing sector and expand my experience and knowledge. If there is a time to discuss any opportunities I am available at any convenience. I am more than happy to share my resume with as well. Thank you.'
