message_body: "Hi, I am trying to organise a mount for a Printer in order to mount our MFY Printer in kitchen - I am unsure of the model number, however we do have one printer mount which is stainless steel. If possible, can you give us a call on 03 5174 9774 or email us back to confirm if we are able to purchase a printer mount.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nDaniel Bielby"
