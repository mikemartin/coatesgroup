message_body: "Hi there- Quick intro, my name is Tyler Smigelski and I work in the Marketing Dept at White Castle's Home Office.\r\n\r\nIâ€™m reaching out because we here at White Castle are looking to identify a partner to help us optimize, rethink, and redesign our current menu boards across all restaurants. The main objective of this project is to create a visually appealing, easy to read, and appetizing presentation of our uniquely Crave-able menu items, informed by consumer research, test and learn, and/or knowledge of industry best practice. \r\n\r\nI have a full RFP document that I can share with additional details. Is this project something that your team would be interested in? I'd love to connect with someone from your team to learn more about Coates and see if we might be a good fit to tackle this project together.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you."
