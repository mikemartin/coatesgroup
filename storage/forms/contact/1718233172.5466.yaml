message_body: 'I work for Arrow and have made a recent discovery that I would like to share to the CEO Leo Coates. I am not privy to the contract between Arrow and Coates but I believe there might be a violation in this signed contract. Is Leo Coates aware that the Phoenix site is no longer producing Coates but acting as a middle man. Before I get into the middle man part let me give you a timeline of events. When Coates signed the contract with Arrow we were producing roughly 300 Coates per day to fulfill the demand. This then led to disastrous results due to the Seneca Team being to small to produce such a number in a single day. This was outsourced to other departments with no experience and received no training which resulted in FQRs. The decision was made to have these pre assembled in Taiwan by GigaiPC and then loaded with Coates software at the Phoenix site. There was a decision within local and corporate management to shut down Seneca. The Production manager Thomas King and possibly the GM Emily Hoyte made the decision to have GigaiPC to build and load your custom image in Taiwan. We are currently going through the Pilot phase to validate the software. There is zero production taking place at the Phoenix site now and your product is going to be treated as a pick n ship. Arrow is allowing GigaiPC which is not owned by Arrow and is located in Taiwan to have access to your software. There is a currently labeling issue as the labeling reflects "Manufactured by Arrow" and "Built in Taiwan". These are not manufactured by Arrow. They are now trying to figure out how to reproduce the labeling scheme so that it matches system there were manufactured here at the Phoenix site. Please see that this reaches Leo Coates.'
