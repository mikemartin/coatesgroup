message_body: "I've joined Theravada, a solution provider in Europe. \r\nOur chairman, Steve Tiley, is previously a McDonalds CIO, ex-Acrelec and former chairman/investor of QikServe.\r\nWe’ve secured major business in Europe (thousands of locations for drive-thru) and are midway through a 650-store rollout in Spain. \r\nWe do not yet have a kiosk solution to sell in Europe, and I have been brought on board to spearhead this opportunity among other things.\r\n\r\nI heard some very good things about Coates, and they were a very strong competitor for my colleague looking after McDonalds at my previous employer. \r\n\r\nI would like to investigate the opportunity of a partnership between Theravada and Coates specifically for Europe.\r\nWe are only looking for large customers/rollouts and believe there could be a mutually beneficial opportunity here. \r\nIf you think it’s worth a chat, very happy to arrange a call.\r\n\r\nI appreciate this is probably a bit leftfield for you and would love to hear your thoughts."
