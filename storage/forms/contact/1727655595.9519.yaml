message_body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI recently applied for the Portfolio Manager role posted on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4025861742\r\n\r\nAnd received an email response stating:\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we are unable to move forward with your application at this time. While your skills and experience are impressive, your salary expectations are outside the compensation range we have established for this position.\r\n\r\nThe salary expectation I provided is of course flexible given it is heavily dependant on the construct and responsibilities of the role.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to provide your approved compensation range to determine if it is a possibility to proceed with further discussions on the role?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nDavid Bond\r\n+61 4 7744 6117\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbondnz/"
