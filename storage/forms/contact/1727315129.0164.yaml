message_body: "Require a couple of column type free standing light box drive thru menu boards similar to the old school ones you guys have done in the past for Maccas, Zarraffas, etc before they all went digital. Need to be able to be able to swap out translight menus when changes are required - basically a low cost drive thru menu board option.\r\n\r\nWe are on the Gold Coast, Queensland.\r\n\r\nI know this is a very small request for you guys but thought you may be able to help. If not, could you recommend anyone?\r\n\r\nEven 2nd hand ex Maccas or alike that have been upgraded would do the job."
