Unfortunately, we have lost the physical key to access one of the kiosks, and as a result, we are unable to service or manage the internal components of the unit.\r\n\r\nWe kindly request your assistance in:\r\n\r\n1. Supplying a replacement lock and key for the affected kiosk unit, or\r\n2. Advising on the best course of action to regain access and ensure the kiosk is secure and operational.\r\nIf possible, please advise the estimated turnaround time, cost, and whether a technician visit is required to install the new lock.\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate your prompt response as this issue is affecting our store operations.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMd Riazuddin Mazumder\r\nOperations Technology Programs Manager\r\nMcDonald’s Hancock Jones Group\r\nPort Macquarie Highway"
