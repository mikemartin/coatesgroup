How does the programing of the boards work. \r\n\r\nThe customer is AAA. They have two car wash locations they would like to put items on at the entrance to the washes. \r\nPrices, options, ect…\r\nOne location would get two menu boards – one for each drive thru lane\r\nOne location would get one menu board – one for the single lane. \r\nThese would be the ground mounted units. The two panel – 4’ x 4’ units. \r\n\r\nAnyway, please let me know."
