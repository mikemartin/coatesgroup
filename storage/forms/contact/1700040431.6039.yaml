message_body: "Hi, I am a Sign installer of 12 years. I have worked across many major brands in Australia such as Ampol, BP, Oporto, Red Rooster, Chicken Treat, Aufo Masters. City Discount tyres, Continental Tyres, Forty Winks and I put my name and legacy in perfecting the art of signage to match the high detail and demand of hiring clients. \r\n\r\nI am aware that Australia is giving McDonalds a facelift and moving to the Aussie way of life and changing to Maccas. This is amazing. I am located in Perth Western Australia and interested in working with other sign companies on your project.\r\n\r\nAre you able to provide some Sign Companies on the rebranding and I can contact them direct?\r\n\r\nI am confident I achieve impeccable results through qualification and many years in the job"
