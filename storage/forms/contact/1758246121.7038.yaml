message_body: "Dear Coates Group,\r\n\r\nI recently applied to the Content Services Manager position and wanted to follow up to express my continued enthusiasm for this potential opportunity.\r\n\r\nI'm currently planning to relocate to the Chicago area by the end of the year and believe this role’s focus on content management, cross-functional collaboration, and client engagement aligns closely with my experience in project management.\r\n\r\nIn my current role, I oversee day-to-day team activities, manage timelines, and partner with both internal teams and clients to deliver clean products. \r\n\r\nI would love the opportunity to discuss how my background in project management and client strategy could support the success of Coates Group’s Content Services team. Could you let me know if there are any updates regarding my application or the next steps in the hiring process? If there is anything else you may need from me, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAlex Jackson"
