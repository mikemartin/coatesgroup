message_body: "It has come to my attention from many McDonald's owners that you will be replacing the discoloring 55 inch drive through digital signage screens. \r\nI am located in Kansas City MO. I have replaced many many of these in the KC area for kinetics and USSI. \r\nWith such a large project I would like to make a proposal on the repair of said product mentioned previously.\r\nI currently have a 9000 square foot warehouse and the ability to repair instead of destroying the used damaged monitors if shipped to me. And supplied with the correct parts I believe it could save you massive in the long run and give a faster more efficient means to a end.\r\nNeal Huggins\r\n913-827-2828"
