message_body: "I am interested in the media player roll outs underway in the US.   I was given the information from a Workmarket client.   We are interested in multiple states and areas.   We have worked on media player installs and at Dunkin Donuts, McDonald's, 7elevens and other clients with menuboards both inside and outdoors.   We have several techs and are willing to travel to areas with concentrated work and understand that means doing the one off locations also in the more remote areas."
