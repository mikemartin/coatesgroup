message_body: "Hey Coates Crew! \r\n\r\nJust wanted to introduce myself and see if maybe I can be of service to hometown! Your model is very cool and it would be cool to be considered for a capabilities presentation for any live action video or motion graphics vendor needs you might have. \r\n\r\nI also own a small production company, Big Foot Media (bigfootcreates.com) on the north side of Chicago have have done a decent amount of work within the craft beer industry including some cool tabletop stuff (see a taste here: https://vimeo.com/user/8886671/folder/18428762) that could be a good fit for some of the digital/interactive display work you do for menus and signs. \r\n\r\nWe have great relationships with studios in town as well as high speed camera ops, robotics operators, etc. \r\n\r\nAnyways, would love to chat more and see if maybe we might be a good fit for you to keep in mind for the future!\r\n\r\nThanks and have a great rest of your week!"
