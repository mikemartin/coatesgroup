message_body: "Hello,\r\nWe had an outdoor digital menu board replaced that was hit by a car.  The insurance company needs pictures that were provided to COATES last year.  I can’t find the pictures and was hoping you had them on an old email.  The email would be from cedcota@yucca.net for McDonald’s national number 4787 in Portales, NM.  Any chance the pictures on the email can be found and sent back to me?"
