message_body: "Hi Team, \r\n\r\nI from Revesby Macca's. \r\n\r\nThe receipt printers for my kiosks are currently not printing receipts. Everything is configured correctly and the printers are working, however for all 6 of the kiosks a printer error always comes up. We have had the kiosks recently fixed by McDFix and we think that this was part of the issue. \r\n\r\nWould a technician be able to come out to have a look at our kisosk please?\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nCherry\r\nRestaurant Manager\r\nRevesby McDonald's Australia\r\nONE McOpCo"
