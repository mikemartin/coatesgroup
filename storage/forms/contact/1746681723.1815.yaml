To achieve this, we are looking to deploy kiosks at trade counters for self-service ordering.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking a scalable solution that integrates with the following platforms:\r\n\r\nAdobe Commerce (Magento)\r\n\r\nNetSuite\r\n\r\nStripe\r\n\r\nIn addition, we would appreciate details regarding:\r\n\r\nRecommended hardware specifications\r\n\r\nSupported operating systems\r\n\r\nSoftware deployment and update processes\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if your solution can support our needs, and if so, we'd welcome a call or demonstration to discuss further.\r\n\r\nHaven Ramos\r\n0452598251"
