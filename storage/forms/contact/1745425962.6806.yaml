message_body: "Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nwe are an Austrian Startup developing procurement and project management software for the construction industry and we are currently planning a research project in cooperation with the Austrian state. For this research project we would need a kiosk terminal. After researching I found your new K2 terminals and would like to get a little bit more information about them and a quotation. The only requirement we have for the kiosk is that it should be capable of scanning QR codes. \r\n\r\nIn case that the research project is successful, we would like to use the kiosks for the commercial product then. Of course we would be grateful if you could provide a kiosk for the research and development purposes.\r\n\r\nThanks and best regards,\r\nMichael Ramel"
