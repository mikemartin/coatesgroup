message_body: "My name is Brady, and I’m with Baer’s Sign Service. I’m reaching out on behalf of a customer who owns a local ice cream shop and is looking to upgrade their current menu board system.\r\n\r\nRight now, they’re using a basic poster setup—either printing out or handwriting their offerings and flavors. They’re looking to modernize their image and streamline the process with a digital solution that allows for easy updates to flavors, pricing, and promotions.\r\n\r\nI was hoping Coates might have a product suited for this application. Ideally, we’re looking for a smaller, slim-profile digital display that’s rated for outdoor use, or at least can be mounted by a walk-up order window without being too bulky.\r\n\r\nIf you have any recommendations or product information that might fit this situation, I’d appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you."
