message_body: "Dear Sir or Madam\r\n\r\nMay we have your attention for just one minute? Don't worry, we don't want to sell you anything, but would be interested in a non-binding exchange with you. \r\n\r\nOur start-up BEAMOTIONS has developed an innovative solution for gesture control.  The idea won an award in the BMWi's start-up competition for digital innovations.\r\n\r\nOur technology can be used to transform conventional, passive screens into interactive displays, for example. Our process is now patented and we are currently working intensively on optimizing our prototype. \r\n\r\nThe exchange with industry experts is of great importance to us at the current stage of development, which is why we would like to talk to you. Your company, Coates, is active in the digital signage sector - an area in which our technology could also have exciting applications. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, we have made a 35-second video available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/JDd_FHJIcQw\r\n\r\nYou can also find more information on our website: www.beamotions.com. \r\n\r\nWe would be delighted to receive your feedback - whether you are interested in a non-binding exchange or have critical comments that could help us further. Thank you in advance for your time and support. \r\n\r\nYours sincerely\r\nRené Rüddenklau"
