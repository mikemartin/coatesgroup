message_body: "Good morning, I am at a McDonalds national 6682 in Spring Hill, FL. The outdoor display unit has two screens and the left side is not coming on. I have an electrician coming to check the power to the unit. I did my own investigation on the outlet in side and the side not working has no power. This store has had some electrical issues from lightning strikes and I am leading to a bad outlet or the two pole breaker in side is bad. Once the electrician confirms what I think it is or he finds another component being bad how fast can we what we need. The model number is \r\nCD-DDT-02-55-3D. My phone number is 352-650-8481if you need to contact me. Thank you for your assistance on this. \r\nSincerely \r\nAngel Rodriguez \r\nService tech"
