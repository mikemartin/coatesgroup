message_body: "Hello,\r\nI am Maria,\r\nI run a small design studio from Belgrade, Europe, and we work for big clients as subcontractors for a couple of US digital agencies. Last year we won a couple of awards for our partner for websites we did design for. I would like to know if you are interested in partnering with us so you can reduce the cost of production and at the same time receive high-end design for your projects. Some of our work can be seen in the showreel video here https://supercluster.studio/\r\nOur services include logo design, branding, UX and UI design, and development in WordPress and Webflow.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.\r\nI would like to schedule a call so we can discuss our collaboration further."
