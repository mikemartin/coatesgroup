message_body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Akos, and over the past couple of days, I have been communicating with a person named Kane Cassidy (kanecassidy@coatesgroupcareer.com) about an IT Support Specialist (remote) role. There was no interview, just a questionnaire, but this morning, I received an offer letter that is signed by \"Ami Patel, Talent Acquisition Manager\". If my past has taught me anything is that if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. And obviously, it did not come from an HR email, but rather from the one listed above. I have checked your listings on the career page, and of course, there is no such position listed. Now, if this is a real opportunity, I will welcome it with open arms, but it just does not feel right. Thank you."
