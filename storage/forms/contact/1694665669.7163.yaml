message_body: "Hi HR Department,\r\n\r\nHope you are having a wonderful day!\r\n\r\nAre you recruiting software engineers and expecting high qualifications with lower rates? If yes, I do believe that our offshore talent solutions will fulfill your expectations. \r\nI'm a Business Manager at Tech Grid Asia (headquarter in Singapore). Our agency helps you find and manage the best offshore software engineers (all skills, multiple levels) with Singapore quality and Vietnamese cost. We wonâ€™t charge any headhunt fee but monthly salary only, and our monthly salary is much lower than local salary because of Vietnam location advantages.\r\n\r\nAny luck, can we have a 10 mins discussion to talk in detail? If yes, can you call me at any time or can you kindly share with me your free time? Thanks.\r\n\r\nThese are benefits our company will give you:\r\n1) Cost effective offshore hiring solutions\r\n2) Good abundant and diverse tech talent pool in Vietnam\r\n3) Ready tech talent on the bench for hiring\r\n3) Hassle free (recruit, shortlist and hire) \r\n4) Payroll, statutory contribution and administration managed by Tech Grid\r\n5) Dedicated account manager on all liaison\r\n6) Vietnam is one of the hot location for offshoring of tech talents\r\n\r\nThis is our company profile: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-wBTI3ZK3Uffgs2JcMPFfgLxrakvbnWb/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nI totally understand if you're too busy to respond, but even a one-or two-line reply would really make my day.\r\n\r\nThanks and best regards,\r\nLucy\r\nlucyvo@techgrid.co\r\nhttps://techgrid.co/global-offshore-talent-solution/"
