message_body: "This message is for Anthony Mizzi.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to rethink your sourcing strategy relative to the tariff situation, CES might be able to help.  We are located just outside of Chicago, and we build electronics boards, cable harnesses, and system level assemblies.  Like you, we are very familiar with system level assembly due to our origins in the gaming industry, e.g. Aristocrat.  I would like the opportunity to discuss how we can help.\r\n\r\nMatt Williams\r\n(630) 204-2377"
