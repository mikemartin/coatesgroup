message_body: "I'm a contract technician. I recently replaced the display on one of your OMB. Along with the new display, I was handed a Coates i3 Fanless Element part # COATES-i3-ELM-NA media player s/n CCP1127888227106. I did not need it for my repair and the company I was working for (CCS) isn't sure where it came from. Can you tell me by the s/n who this media player belongs to?"
