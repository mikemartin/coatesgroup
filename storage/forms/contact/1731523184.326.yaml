message_body: "Reaching out to place an order for the replacement of our existing Texas Digital interior menu board media players for on of our Dunkin' locations.\r\n \r\nWe have a unique situation. We have three locations inside the Bally's Lincoln, RI casino but only two Dunkin' PC numbers. Because of this, we only received new media player for two of the locations and still need the players changed in our third location.\r\n \r\nThe two PC's are 306028 & 331768.\r\n \r\nPlease advise as to how we get an order processed to have this final location's players swapped to Coates. We are currently experiencing issues with the menu boards not displaying content and would like to rectify as soon as possible.\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\n \r\nJohn"
