message_body: "I know you guys have your go to vendor channels for installs and service and most of them go to job boards for back fill which I know is almost a necessary evil especially in hard to reach places… But hear me out…\r\n\r\nMy business partners and I have been in the Field for 30+  years. We just started our new company NextGen QSR we have 4 full time W-2 techs, a network of 30 COMPANIES not just techs nationwide. With that being said we can provide fully capable technicians to your job sites and facilitate training and streamline best practices all while providing amazing customer service. We are HME certified, Low Voltage Licensed, AWS and Google Cloud Partners, FSE Certified (Fortinet), LGE partners, Dell, HPE, Nvidia, and have our own Digital Signage Solution ready to go to market but honestly the path of least resistance would be to join forces with an established company such as your selves and save our resources for other projects. \r\n\r\nDo you guys need some amazing installers and Service Technicians? Also do you offer commission on sales if we were to bring you some larger accounts? For example we service a Taco Bell Franchise with around 300 stores and another with 240 that are not satisfied with Stratacache."
