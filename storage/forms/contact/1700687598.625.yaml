message_body: "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nWe have a client that is looking to update their interior signage package across the country in their retail stores.  They currently have printed fabric signs with frame sin place at varying sizes throughout the country.  The existing stationary signage range from 4’-6’ heigh by 3’-4’ wide.  They also have some larger landscape version as approximately 4’ x 20’.  The client is looking to make the larger initial investment to upgrade to all digital interior signage.  As I am sure there are several “standard’ sizes for these types of interior signage, I am looking to you to make a recommendation on the sizes and types that we can review and recommend to our client for this type of application.\r\n\r\nWe would like to review some different options for data input, resolution, size, and general quality.  Do these displays come in a “Good Better Best” type of layout or is there an industry standard across the board?  Please let me know if this is something you could help with."
