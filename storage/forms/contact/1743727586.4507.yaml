message_body: "Good evening,\r\n\r\nMy name is Danny.  I am an insurance adjuster handling a claim for a Dunkin located at 105 Dundee Road, Arlington Heights, IL 60004.  A vehicle struck this building causing damage to the interior wall.  The menu boards will have to be taken down to facilitate the repairs, then reinstalled.  Our insured is stating that this is required to be done by Coates.  I am inquiring if this is the case, and if you have anything you could send me that states such.  I am also wondering the cost Coates charges to provide such service.  Thank you,  Danny You can email me at MastersonAdjusting@gmail.com or reach me by phone at (815) 566-1857"
