message_body: 'Hello, i was hoping to get an update on the ticket send over from ATOS/Stratacache for McDonalds #27659. These menu boards were installed a month ago and are already not working and have not been working for over a week now. In addition whoever installed these boards did not install the spare runs. This also needs to be addressed as an incomplete installation.'
