message_body: 'Good afternoon, I wanted to inquire about becoming a vendor. We have a lot of experience, installing the coats, menu boards for Starbucks and McDonald’s, but the cabling and provisioning is usually done by others. I’m interested in performing the initial set up as well as repairs. I’d also be open to other opportunities my company might be qualified for. I was looking to see if my company could be of service. We currently cover all of Connecticut, Western Massachusetts, and parts of lower New York. I can be reached via email or at 203.996.5881. Thank you.'
