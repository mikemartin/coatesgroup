message_body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI have a ticket opened (00147837) for a dead menu board. I tried to contact NCR to get a quote to replace the out of warranty screen, but they responded with: This ticket is currently on Coates, we will need to wait for them to provide more information regarding the replacement so we can send you a quote. When they do, we will contact you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nDo I need to get a quote from Coates for a replacement? The ticket has just been sitting there for a while and I'm hoping to get this resolved. \r\n\r\nThank you!"
