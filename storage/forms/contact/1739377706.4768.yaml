message_body: "Hello! I'm looking for info on what you can offer in the way of an exterior wall mounted digital display at 24x36 or 30x46 roughly. I'm not looking for anything custom so whatever standard size you have that is close would be great. This does not need to be high resolution but it does need to have full color capabilities. I don't know if it's possible, but I have a budget of $400 or less."
