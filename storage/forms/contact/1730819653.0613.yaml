message_body: "Dear Coates Team,\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about any open positions that may align with my background in technical support. I have 5 years of experience working with Dunkin Donuts' Digital Menu Board solutions, both indoor and drive-thru, including hardware support, application software, and troubleshooting. My role involved regular communication with customers and collaboration with various teams connected to the restaurants, ensuring efficient and effective service.\r\nIf there are any relevant openings, I would be grateful for the chance to discuss how I could contribute to Coates.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJovan Stojkovic"
