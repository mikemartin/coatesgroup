message_body: "Dear HR,\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Abhishek Gurav, and I am an aspiring QA professional with hands-on experience in both manual and automation testing, gained through my internship. During this internship, I worked on real-time projects that involved API testing, Selenium automation, and payment gateway functionality testing, which helped me strengthen my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.\r\n\r\nAs part of the internship, I contributed to testing applications such as the HRMS application, voting application and ecommerce Web application. My responsibilities included creating and executing test cases, troubleshooting Selenium automation issues, and thoroughly testing functional and UI elements. Additionally, I completed professional training in software testing through ExcelR Solutions, which provided me with a solid foundation in tools like Selenium and TestNG.\r\n\r\nI am now looking for opportunities to further my career as a Software Testing Engineer, and I noticed that your company has roles that align with my skills and experiences. I would be grateful if you could consider referring me for any suitable positions within your organization.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information, such as my updated resume. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAbhishek Gurav\r\nPhone: 9380521827/ 9480643027"
