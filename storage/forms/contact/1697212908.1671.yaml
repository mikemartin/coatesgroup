message_body: "I recently applied to a backend engineering position and received an email from the recruiter responsible for the role, Ami Patel. After some back and forth, Ami has stopped responding to my emails or phone calls regarding a phone screening.\r\n\r\nI had since reached out to who I assumed was Ami's superior, Stu M who has also not responded to me. I'm still interested in this position and would like to understand why both Miss Patel and Stu have ignored me.\r\n\r\nJames"
