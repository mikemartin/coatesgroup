message_body: "I am writing on behalf of Suhail Sitaf- we were scheduled to have a media player replacement for PC: 359786 on 7/25/24 but there was an issue with one of the units, so someone was dispatched on 8/1/24, to replace and fix the issue. However, they informed me that due to the serial numbers not matching, they had to take the screen back and will be unable to resolve it until the correct one is connected to the ticket. \r\n\r\nPlease see the information given from the technician that was onsite:\r\nModel Code- LH50QMBEBGCXGO\r\nVersion No.- Da01 / QMB\r\nSerial Number: 0DR5HCXW301198Z"
