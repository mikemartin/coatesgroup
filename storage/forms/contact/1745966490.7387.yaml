message_body: "Hello, \r\nMy name's Cris and I'm the OTP Pro at McDonald's #12409.  We had an indoor digital menu board replaced late last year (2024) and still have the original monitor/tv.  We also had our 6 ODMBs replaced in February of this year, 2025, as part of the browning out program and those were already picked up.  Was there supposed to be a separate scheduled pick up for this IMDB?  Please advise.  \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nCris Aragon"
