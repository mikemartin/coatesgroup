message_body: "Hello,\r\nMy name is Gawshika Aumkaran and I recently applied for the UX Designer position. I'm just enquiring to see if there have been any updates on the process. I actually haven't received any confirmation email that my application went through at all (I tested the application with another email and received the same results of no confirmation email).  \r\nI am excited at the prospect of working for Coates Group and I believe I can excel in this role. I would be happy to provide any additional documents if needed to further demonstrate my fit for the role or discuss this role more in detail.\r\nThank you for your time. Looking forward to hearing from you!"
